<h1>fuckamonitor</h1>
Monitors the addition of currencies on several cryptocurrency exchanges.

<h2>Why?</h2>
As the past shows, upon new cryptocurrency listings on major exchanges, the price skyrockets within minutes before falling. `fuckamonitor` monitors leading crypto exchanges for new listings with up to a 15-second delay.

<h2>Efficiency?</h2>
Rather than using exchange API's (which are often delayed in updating listings), <code>fuckamonitor</code> monitors several sources including exchange announcements, social media accounts, and forum posts.

<h2>Profit?</h2>
Reach out to me for more details on implementation.
